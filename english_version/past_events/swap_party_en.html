    <h1>Our First Eco Swap Party at Matnas Hadar</h1>
    <p>
      In early March, we held a festive Eco Swap Party at Matnas Hadar, Beitar St. 8 (מתנ״ס הדר בית״ר 8).
      Huge thanks to the wonderful Matnas team for their help — thanks to them, the event turned out
      warm, friendly, and inspiring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea was simple but important: to create an eco-friendly way to refresh the wardrobe before
      International Women's Day (March 8) and prepare costumes for Purim by giving unwanted clothes
      a new home. Everyone could bring clothes, exchange, or take something they liked.
    </p>

    <h3>👚 What Happened</h3>
    <p>
      As often happens, people brought much more clothing than they took. This reflects our shared problem:
      in a consumer society, we buy clothes not only when we really need them but also under the influence
      of advertising and trends — leading to overconsumption and waste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks to everyone who came — and especially to those who took clothes and continue wearing them!
      You gave these things another life before they could end up in a landfill or an incinerator.
      Unfortunately, Israel still lacks proper textile recycling infrastructure.
    </p>

    <h3>🌿 Our Contribution</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We held an <a href="/past_events/slow_fashion_swap_party.pdf" class="pdf-link">interactive lecture</a> on eco-friendly textile reuse options.</li>
      <li>Part of the clothing was donated to the World WIZO charity organization.</li>
      <li>Some items are stored by our volunteer, awaiting the next swap event.</li>
      <li>Children and adults enjoyed a creative clothing-painting workshop where old clothes gained a new artistic life.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🤝 We Aim to Change Consumption Culture</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>buy less and wear longer;</li>
      <li>support local brands;</li>
      <li>swap instead of throwing away.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>💚 Thank you to everyone for the warm atmosphere!</p>
