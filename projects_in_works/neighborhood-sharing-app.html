    <h1>Project Proposal: Neighborhood Sharing App</h1>
    <h2>A Digital Platform for Community Resource Sharing</h2>

    <h3>Project Goal:</h3>
    <p>
      The goal of this project is to develop an internet application for local residents that enables
      them to share, donate, or lend items within their neighborhood. Items can be offered for free,
      in exchange for mutual help, or through barter. While commercial advertisements by participants
      are excluded, local businesses may promote their services, with payments going exclusively to
      the app’s administration to sustain operations.
    </p>

    <h3>Project Description:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>App Features and Functionality:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Item Listings:</strong> Residents can list household goods, tools, books, toys, or unused materials (e.g., paints, adhesives, screws, craft supplies, maintenance products). Listings include description, condition, and sharing terms.</li>
          <li><strong>Search & Filter:</strong> Users can search by category, availability, and sharing terms.</li>
          <li><strong>Sharing Terms:</strong> Options include free sharing, help exchange, or trade for another item. The app facilitates direct communication between neighbors.</li>
          <li><strong>Exclusion of Commercial Ads:</strong> Residents cannot sell items or services. Local businesses, however, may advertise their services (home repairs, gardening, cleaning), with payments directed to app operations.</li>
          <li><strong>Local Business Support:</strong> A dedicated section for vetted local business ads, ensuring alignment with community values.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Logistics and Support Services:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Furniture Assembly/Transport:</strong> Equipment provided for assembling/disassembling furniture and transporting heavy items within the community.</li>
          <li><strong>Short-Term Storage:</strong> A rented facility for temporary storage of bulky items until pickup or delivery.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Community Engagement and Education:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>App as a digital hub promoting sharing, cooperation, and mutual support.</li>
          <li>Workshops and events to teach app usage, sharing benefits, and waste reduction.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Benefits for Participants:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Access to a wide range of items without purchasing, lowering costs and encouraging sustainability.</li>
      <li>Stronger community bonds through cooperation and mutual aid.</li>
      <li>Support for local businesses, whose contributions sustain the platform.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Financial Model:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Funding through payments from local businesses for ad space within the app.</li>
      <li>Additional support via resident donations or grants for community development and sustainability.</li>
      <li>Operates as a non-profit, reinvesting all funds into the community and platform maintenance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
    <p>
      The Neighborhood Sharing App will foster a culture of cooperation and reduce waste by enabling
      resource sharing within neighborhoods. By connecting residents and supporting local businesses,
      the app enhances community well-being while promoting sustainable practices. With potential
      expansion through partnerships with governments, NGOs, and other communities, the project
      offers a scalable model for wider adoption of resource efficiency and community engagement.
