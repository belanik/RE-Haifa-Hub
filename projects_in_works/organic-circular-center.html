    <h1>Project Proposal: Cooperative "Organic Cycle"</h1>
    <h2>Exchange of Urban Community Organic Waste for Agricultural Products</h2>

    <h3>Project Goal:</h3>
    <p>
      The goal of this project is to establish a sustainable closed-loop exchange system in which
      the local community transfers organic waste to agricultural enterprises in return for fresh
      agricultural products. This initiative reduces waste and strengthens local production.
    </p>

    <h3>Project Description:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Organic Waste Collection:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Members collect organic waste in special recycled paper bags or envelopes, easy to carry and dispose of.</li>
          <li>Containers for waste collection placed in secured community locations.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Exchange System Organization:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Agricultural enterprises use collected organic waste as compost or animal feed.</li>
          <li>Cooperative members receive discounts on agricultural products (vegetables, fruits, dairy) and can pre-order via web app.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Access Algorithm:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>A digital platform verifies participants as local cooperative members with agreements with producers.</li>
          <li>Algorithm ensures only registered members access the system.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Benefits for Participants:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduced household waste and environmental footprint.</li>
      <li>Access to fresh, eco-friendly agricultural products.</li>
      <li>Strengthened community ties and support for local farmers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Financial Model:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Startup funding through membership fees or partnerships with local businesses.</li>
      <li>Revenue from product sales reinvested into waste processing and exchange development.</li>
      <li>Possible methods: composting, anaerobic digestion, vermiculture (Californian worms), or black soldier fly larvae farming.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
    <p>
      The Cooperative "Organic Cycle" offers an innovative model for organic waste management,
      combining environmental, economic, and social benefits. It supports sustainable development
      and strengthens community resilience. Expansion opportunities include collaboration with local
      governments, schools, and private companies to create an integrated waste-to-product system.
