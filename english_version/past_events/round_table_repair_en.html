    <h1>♻️ Round Table: Furniture Repair and Recycling — in Haifa</h1>
    <p>
      On June 5, 2025, from 17:00 to 19:30, in Room 216 at Palmer Gate 1, Haifa, a round table was held:
      “Furniture Repair and Recycling. Second Life for Things — A Dialogue about Haifa’s Future.”  
      This meeting brought together activists and residents of the city to discuss how useful furniture should not end up in landfills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thoughtless disposal of items is unacceptable. We believe that good furniture should not be left on the street.  
      Many people face difficulties removing heavy, unneeded items from their apartments.  
      On their way to the dumpster, they often get damaged and lose value — even though others need simple tables, beds, and chairs.  
      Together we can exchange, reuse, and preserve valuable resources — saving money, reducing waste, and lowering our climate footprint.  
      Let’s respect what we already have and build a greener, fairer Haifa.
    </p>

    <h3>🌱 Why It Matters</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Extending furniture lifespan through repair and reuse helps reduce waste, ease pressure on landfills, and save household budgets.</li>
      <li>It’s a matter of social justice: some have too much, while others lack the essentials — exchange and recycling connect these needs.</li>
      <li>For Haifa, such initiatives are a step toward a sustainable city where resources are used respectfully and climate awareness becomes part of daily life.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We are developing the RE-Haifa Hub project — a multifunctional eco-center that will host workshops, trainings, educational seminars, meetings, and joint initiatives.  
      We are currently preparing the project and seeking financial support to make it a reality.
