    <h1>Tiny Eco Heroes: Give Your Toys a New Adventure</h1>
    <p>
      In Haifa on June 6, 2025, we hosted a wonderful children’s event — Tiny Eco Heroes: Give Your
      Toys a New Adventure — as part of the “Yarok” festival. The event took place in Lower Town, at
      Palmer Gate 1, room 211. There was a great turnout — children and their parents participated
      with enthusiasm. At the event we organized a toy swap, built “toy houses” together, and held
      workshops to create hybrid toys from old parts — all to show that toys can be given a new life
      and that we can make something creative instead of just throwing things away.
    </p>

    <h3>🌱 Why It Matters</h3>
    <p>
      It is crucial for children and parents to learn to handle toys responsibly — to buy only what’s
      truly needed, take good care, and share — which means less waste and more joy. In many countries
      there are “toy libraries,” collection and refurbishment programs, or projects that make toys from
      recycled materials — such initiatives show that a more sustainable way of consumption is possible.
      For Haifa, the reuse and exchange of toys and children’s items is a chance to strengthen the community,
      reduce environmental impact, and teach the younger generation to respect resources.
    </p>

    <p>
      We plan to further develop this direction — to hold such events regularly, add more workshops,
      emphasize creativity, and collaborate with kindergartens and schools so that the idea of a
      sustainable approach to toys becomes part of our everyday life.
