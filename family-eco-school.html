    <h1>Project Proposal: Family Eco-School</h1>
    <h2>Modeling the Life Cycle of Household Items for Mending and Creative Transformation</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Project Goal</h3>
      <p>
        The goal of this project is to establish a family eco-school where participants, including children and adults, can learn to model the life cycle of household items such as clothing, furniture, and other everyday objects. The focus will be on teaching mending skills and creative transformation techniques, empowering families to extend the lifespan of their possessions and reduce waste within their own homes.
