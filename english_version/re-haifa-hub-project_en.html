    <h1>🌿 Re‑Haifa Hub — a New Environmental Center in Haifa 🌿</h1>
    <p>
      We are a group of Russian‑speaking volunteers who live by the “zero waste” principle and do
      everything possible to promote this approach in everyday life. Today we are working on creating
      a multifunctional environmental center “Re‑Haifa‑Hub” in Haifa or Tirat Carmel.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be an open space where everyone can contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle and
      also find something useful and inspiring for themselves.
    </p>

    <h3>✨ What will be in Re‑Haifa Hub?</h3>
    <p>🔧 <strong>DIY Repair Hall</strong><br>
      Here you will be able to repair clothing, furniture, and household items. We will equip the
      space with everything needed: a sewing machine, sander, router, and other tools that are not
      always at hand at home but are needed from time to time.
    </p>
    <p>🎨 <strong>Workshop Space</strong><br>
      We will conduct classes on restoration, upcycling, furniture refurbishing, and other practices
      of mindful consumption. Anyone can learn to give things a second life.
    </p>
    <p>🛋 <strong>Showroom of Refurbished Furniture</strong><br>
      You will be able to purchase restored and transformed interior items. In this way we want to
      reduce the amount of bulky waste that currently goes to landfills and is not recycled.
    </p>
    <p>🌱 <strong>Urban Gardening Area</strong><br>
      On the roof or in a specially equipped area we plan to create a zone for growing plants
      and promoting home composting methods. This will help residents produce quality soil and see
      how the ecological cycle closes.
    </p>
    <p>🏺 <strong>“Museum of Unnecessary Things”</strong><br>
      It will feature collections showing that even items that seem like trash have aesthetic value.
      For example, a collection of perfume bottles — each bottle was created by a designer. We will
      also host exhibitions by artists working with “discarded materials.”
    </p>

    <h3>🌍 Why We Are Doing This</h3>
    <p>
      We believe that a strong, friendly local environmental community will grow around the center.
      Re‑Haifa Hub will become a magnet for creative youth seeking to live by the “zero waste”
      principle. At the same time, it will be a place where every city resident will find something
      valuable: affordable prices, engaging leisure, and new skills and knowledge in ecology.
    </p>

    <p>
      💚 We are confident that Re‑Haifa Hub will become not just a center but a genuine growth point
      for Haifa — a step toward a greener, fairer, and modern city.
