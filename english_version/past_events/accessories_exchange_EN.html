    <h1>🌸 Eco Exchange of Jewelry and Women's Accessories 🌸</h1>
    <p>
      On June 7, 2025, as part of the Green Festival, we held a bright and inspiring event in Haifa —
      “New Life for Things, New Friends for You.” The event took place in the Lower Town (Palmer Gate 1,
      Room 211) and brought together more than 30 participants who exchanged jewelry, accessories,
      cosmetics, and other delightful little items. 💍✨ Each woman found something new for herself and gave
      a second life to things that had been gathering dust unused.

    <h3>🌱 Why It Matters</h3>
    <p>
      We reduce waste and extend the life of things instead of sending them to landfills.
      We save resources because producing and delivering new trinkets requires energy and materials.
      We strengthen our community: new friendships, shared stories, and mutual support are born in
      such warm encounters.
    </p>
    <p>
      🚫 This is our response to the thoughtless buying of “cheap trinkets” on AliExpress: those things
      quickly become boring, break, and turn into waste. Here, each item gets a new owner and new value.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thanks to all participants for the joy, atmosphere, and inspiration! 💚
      See you at our next events 🌿
